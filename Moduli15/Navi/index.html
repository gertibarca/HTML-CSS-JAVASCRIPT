        <h1>Welcome to Our CSS Positioning Tutorial!</h1>
        <p>
            This page demonstrates various CSS positioning techniques such as <strong>static</strong>, 
            <strong>relative</strong>, <strong>fixed</strong>, and <strong>absolute</strong> positioning. 
            Understanding how to position elements is crucial in web design, and this tutorial will show you how to 
            use these methods to create sophisticated layouts.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            As you scroll down, you will see examples of each positioning type in action. These examples will help 
            you understand how each type of positioning behaves, and where and why you might want to use each one in 
            your web projects.
        </p>
        
        <h2>What is CSS Positioning?</h2>
        <p>
            CSS positioning allows you to control the layout of elements on the page by setting their position in 
            relation to their container or the viewport. There are different types of positioning, each serving 
            a unique purpose:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Static Positioning:</strong> The default positioning for elements. Elements are positioned 
            based on the normal document flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Relative Positioning:</strong> An element is positioned relative to its normal position 
            in the document flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Fixed Positioning:</strong> An element is fixed in place relative to the viewport and 
            does not scroll with the page.</li>
            <li><strong>Absolute Positioning:</strong> An element is positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor, 
            or to the document body if no ancestor has a position.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Static Positioning</h3>
        <p>
            Static positioning is the default setting for most HTML elements. When an element is statically positioned, 
            it is placed according to the normal document flow, which means it appears where it naturally would based 
            on the surrounding content.
        </p>
        <div id="static">
            <h4>Static Positioning Example</h4>
            <p>This div uses static positioning. It stays where it is in the flow of the document, and will not move or 
            change unless affected by other layout properties.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Relative Positioning</h3>
        <p>
            When you use relative positioning, the element is positioned relative to where it would normally be in the document flow. 
            It can be moved using properties like `top`, `right`, `bottom`, and `left`, but it will still take up space in the document, 
            unlike fixed or absolute positioning.
        </p>
        <div id="relative">
            <h4>Relative Positioning Example</h4>
            <p>This div uses relative positioning. It’s moved 20px down from its original position in the document flow.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Fixed Positioning</h3>
        <p>
            Fixed positioning allows an element to stay in place even when the page is scrolled. The element will be positioned 
            relative to the viewport, meaning it remains in the same spot even as the user scrolls through the page.
        </p>
        <div id="fixed">
            <h4>Fixed Positioning Example</h4>
            <p>This div uses fixed positioning. It stays in place even when you scroll the page.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h3>Absolute Positioning</h3>
        <p>
            Absolute positioning places an element relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (a parent element that has any 
            positioning other than `static`). If no ancestor has a position, it will be positioned relative to the document body.
        </p>
        <div id="parent">
            <h4>Absolute Positioning Example</h4>
            <p>This div is positioned inside a parent container with relative positioning. The child div uses absolute positioning.</p>
            <div id="absolute">
                <h5>Absolute Positioned Div</h5>
                <p>This inner div uses absolute positioning and is placed inside a parent container.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
        
        <h2>When to Use Each Positioning Type</h2>
        <p>
            - Use <strong>static</strong> positioning when you want elements to flow naturally with the page layout (most common).<br>
            - Use <strong>relative</strong> positioning when you want to adjust an element's position without affecting the layout around it.<br>
            - Use <strong>fixed</strong> positioning for elements that should stay in the same spot on the screen regardless of scrolling, like navigation bars or floating buttons.<br>
            - Use <strong>absolute</strong> positioning when you need precise control over an element's location within a parent container, especially when creating complex layouts.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Additional CSS Layout Techniques</h2>
        <p>
            Besides positioning, there are other important layout techniques you should be familiar with, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Flexbox:</strong> A layout model for aligning items in rows or columns with flexible widths and heights.</li>
            <li><strong>Grid Layout:</strong> A two-dimensional layout system that lets you create complex grid structures.</li>
            <li><strong>Float:</strong> An older method for aligning elements horizontally, though it’s generally replaced by Flexbox and Grid in modern web design.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            CSS positioning is essential for creating web layouts that are both flexible and visually appealing. Each positioning 
            method has its own advantages and use cases. As you work with these techniques, you'll get a better understanding of 
            how to use positioning effectively in real-world projects.
